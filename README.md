# Overview
This repo contains the following Programming Historian lesson:
- [Counting Word Frequencies with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/counting-frequencies)

This lesson teaches the fundamentals of analyzing text by calculating word frequencies, a foundational technique in text analysis. It guides the reader through the process of taking a cleaned list of words from a text, counting how often each word appears, and organizing these counts using Python's data structures: first with lists and then more efficiently with dictionaries. It also introduces loops, list comprehensions, and dictionaries, and walks the reader through building functions to create word-frequency dictionaries and sort them by frequency.

In approaching this lesson, I started by manually counting word occurrences, then automated the process with Python. I learned how to filter out common "stop words" (like "the" and "and") to focus on more important terms. All these steps turn into a script that analyzes the word frequencies of any text.
